# Dyna - Home Automation

> We are currently working on the electronic part for Dyna. There will not be a lot of activity on the Github page since its mostly physical. It will all be documented when everything is done.

Dyna is currently a small project that started as an assistent for desktops but moved over to home automation.

## Planned features

-   **Configurability:** All settings and features are customizable in the configuration files and via a web-interface.
-   **Web Interface:** This will come in one of the later stages of Dyna as we want to make things work first.
