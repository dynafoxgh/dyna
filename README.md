# Dyna - Home Automation

> We are currently working on the electronic part for Dyna. There will not be a lot of activity on the Github page since its mostly physical. It will all be documented when everything is done.

Dyna is currently a small project that started as an assistent for desktops but moved over to home automation.

-   **Configurable:** Dyna has lots of settings that can be changed from other devices.
-   **Web Interface:** A very user friendly interface to change settings.
